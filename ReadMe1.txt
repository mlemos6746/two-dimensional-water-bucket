I used for loops to put each possible coordinate (x,y) into a comboAray [x,y]. 
This method worked, and I realized I did not need the array at all, 
I could just compare the x and y's dirrectly in the for loops as i, j and height[i] and height[j].
I decided negative values should be treated as 0. currMax is set to 0 in the start of the program so negative areas are discarded.
